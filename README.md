Introduction:
This game is about stealing, you need to steal and resell items and make the most amount of money in the time allotted to you by the demo. The catch is, you cannot get caught by the NPCs. If they catch you, you will lose some of your money. Each item has a rarity and that rarity will affect how much the item is worth. So steal from as many NPCs as you can to your hearts content, then profit before time runs out. Oh yea you can also pick up items, but I guarantee its a lot more fun to steal your loot! Good Luck player!
